# The context of Climate data

### Coordinated efforts often as part of the World Climate Research Program:

- CMIP, PMIP, CORDEX
- ERA5, UERRA (re-analysis)
- EBAS, AEROCOM

**Data is usually distributed and available online through portals (ESGF, EBAS, AEROCOM, etc.): Standardized procedures (common variables names, units, metadata conventions) and quality control before publishing data**.


### Individual work and blue skies research:

- Sometimes serve to advance scientific knowledge in particular areas, often focused on addressing/validating specific questions or theories, and ought to benefit the community, eventually (improve models, measurement instruments, data analysis, etc.).


**Data is by design/purpose unorganized, unconstrained, unstandardized, unchecked, and for the vast majority usually unusable outside the project/lab/researcher.**


An exhanustiv list of climate data relevant for the Climate Science Demonstrator is given in [EOSC-Nordic Task 5.3](02-eosc-tasks/).
