# EOSC Nordic WP5 tasks

> ## T5.2.1: Cross-border data processing workflows (M1-36) - Lead: UT/ETAIS Participants: UIO-USIT/SIGMA2,
> UICE, SNIC, UGOT/GGBC, FMI, SU/SNIC, UIO-GEO/SIGMA2
> In this subtask, we will facilitate data pre- and post-processing workflows (High Performance computation or High
> Throughput computation) on distributed data and computing resources by enabling community specific or thematic
> portals, such as PlutoF [https://plutof.ut.ee/] and Galaxy-based [https://usegalaxy.eu/] geoportal, traditionally
> designed to submit jobs on local clusters, to allow scheduling of jobs on remote resources. The API modules that
> will be developed to support the most commonly and widely used Distributed Resource Managers (DRMs) will be
> designed to become a generic solution, i.e. independent from the architecture and the technology of any given portal.

> ## T5.2.2: Code Repositories, Containerization and “virtual laboratories” (M1-36) - Lead: SIGMA2 Participants:
> UICE, CSC, UIO-GEO/SIGMA2, UIO-INF/SIGMA2, UH
> In this subtask, we will pilot solutions for cross-borders “virtual laboratories” to allow researchers to work in a
> common software and data environment regardless which computing infrastructure the analysis is performed on,
> thus ensuring the highest reproducibility of the results. The work will encompass evaluations of different Docker
> Hub technologies provided by the EOSC-hub as well as mechanisms for build automation, package management
> and containerization. The subtask will focus on building a natural language processing laboratory, but the overall
> goal will be to create a generic recipe for building virtual laboratories.

> ## T5.3.1: Integrated Data Management Workflows (M1-36) Lead: CSC – Participants: UIO-INF/SIGMA2, UH, SNIC,
> UICE, UIO-GEO/SIGMA2, FMI, SIGMA2
> This task will provide solutions for facilitating complex data workflows involving disciplines specific repositories,
> data sharing portals (such as Earth System Grid Federation, ESGF) and storage for active computing. An emerging
> HTTP API solution integrated with B2SAFE workflows will be adopted to streamline the creation of replicas of
> community specific data repositories towards the computing sites, where computations can be performed. This task
> will comprise also the adaptation of portals

# Tasks for enabling EOSC Nordic Climate Use case


Based on defined personas and pathways, we have define the following list of tasks and milestones:


1. Information on EOSC-Nordic website 

All potential users need to find relevant information on the [EOSC Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) to start their "journey" with EOSC Nordic.

   - A short description of all the use cases with information about what a user can expect to find by the end of the project. In addition, we should have clear information on the current progress so that users can clearly identify what is already available and what is still under development. 
   
> ## Remark
> The plan for each use case is **NOT** static and will evolve to take into account user and developer feedback.
